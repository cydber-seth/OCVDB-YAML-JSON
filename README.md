# OCVDB-YAML-JSON
Practicing python and getting all Open Cloud Vuln Files into JSON - WIP

I am practicing very rusty programming skills and doing some analysis on Open Cloud Vulnerability Database. 

All Credit to cloudvulndb.org

Current state uses files for processing.

Works on windows 10 

Python File: Open-CVDB-JSONify.py

Commented the crap out of the file.

# WARNING run in an empty folder! (It will delete all yaml/text files during clean up)

Example output
- OCVDB-20221012-211235.json

To Do
- process all in memory
- create CSV output
- follow references to grab additional info.
- try on other OS's
- create a monthly file using freemium cloud funcitions and upload to git.

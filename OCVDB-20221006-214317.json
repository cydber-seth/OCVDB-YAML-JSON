An attacker could have abused\nthis to gain credentials for the VM itself as well as credentials for extensions\nassociated with the VM. Paired with the design of the VMAccess extension (an official\nAzure extension for managing VM credentials), this could have been used to achieve\nprivilege escalation, as an unprivileged attacker would have been able to elevate themselves\nto a higher privileged user by leaking the VMAccess admin password. Additionally, if the VMAccess\npassword happened to be shared among other Azure VMs, the attacker would have been able to perform\nlateral movement to other machines. The root cause of this vulnerability was that the\ncertificates endpoint used for decrypting extension credentials did not validate transport\ncertificates, so an attacker could simply issue their own valid transport certificate.\nMoreover, although an iptables rule was in place to prevent unprivileged access to this\nendpoint, an attacker could bypass it by directing their requests to the Azure IMDS instead,\nwhich happened to be located on the same machine as the certificates endpoint.\n",
